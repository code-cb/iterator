# @codecb/iterator

ðŸŒ¡ An implementation of the [Iterator helpers proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers).

**Note:** This implementation does not strictly follow the proposal. It creates a new base class and works on interfaces (`Iterator`, `AsyncIterator`, `Iterable`, and `AsyncIterable`) rather than inheriting from the real, native [`%IteratorPrototype%` object](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-%iteratorprototype%-object) which is quite awkward to access.

The interesting aspect of this project is it uses `Generator` and `AsyncGenerator` which makes it super easy to handle iteration operations comparing to writing a `next` function ourselves.

See [test cases](./test) to have a taste of what these helpers do and how to use them.
